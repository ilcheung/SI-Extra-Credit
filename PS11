### Now begins the graded problems.

# [PROBLEM 1] 
    # Fill in the definition of the class Post to hold information about one post that you've made on Facebook.
    # Add to the __init__ method additional code to set the instance variables comments and likes. 
    # More instructions about that follow, in the code below.
    # You need to pull out the appropriate data from the json representation of a single post. 
    # You can find a sample in the file samplepost.txt. 
    # There are tests that check whether you've pulled out the right data.
    
class Post():
    """object representing status update"""
    def __init__(self, post_dict={}):

            self.message = post_dict['message']
        else:
            self.message = ""
        # if the post dictionary has a 'comments' key, set an instance variable self.comments
        # to the list of comment dictionaries you extract from post_dict. 
        # Otherwise, set self.comments to be an empty list: []
        # Something similar has already been done for the contents (message) of the original post, 
        # which is the value of the 'message' key in the dictionary, when it is present 
        # (photo posts don't have a message). See above for that code, which you can model the rest after!
        # But, pulling out the list of dictionaries from a post_dict
        # where each dictionary represents a comment from a post_dict 
        # is a little harder. You have to go one level deeper in the data structure 
        # Take a look at the sample of what a post_dict looks like
        # in the file samplepost.txt to figure out where to find information.

        if 'comments' in post_dict:

        # Now, similarly, if the post dictionary has a 'likes' key, set self.likes to
        # the list of likes dictionaries from the corresponding likes dictionary.  
        # Otherwise, if there are no 'likes', set self.likes to an empty list: []

    # [PROBLEM 2] In the Post class, fill in three methods:
    # -- positive() returns the number of words in the message that are in the list of positive words pos_ws (provided in our code)
    # -- negative() returns the number of words in the message taht are in the list of negative words neg_ws (provided in our code)
    # -- emo_score returns the difference between positive and negative scores
    # The beginnings of these functions are below -- fill in the rest of the method code!
    # There are tests of these methods later on.

# to get your access token.

# [PROBLEM 6]

# [PROBLEM 7]

# Output a .csv file that lets you make scatterplots showing 
# net positivity on x-axis and comment-counts and like-counts on the y-axis. 
# Each row should represent one post and have: emo score, comment counts, and like counts.

fbcsv.close()

# You can see what the scatterplot might look
# like in emo_scores.xlsx. (In the example case, there's not an obvious
# correlation between positivity and how many comments or likes. There may not be,
# but you find that out by exploring the data!)

# Can you see any trend in whether your friends are more likely 
# to respond to positive vs. negative posts? That question is not graded, but something to think about.
# Post a screenshot of your scatterplot to the facebook group!
